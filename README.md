# Machine-Safety-IOT

Safety of machine safety at abnormal activity to avoid wearing and tearing of machines and avoiding accidents due to negligence and errors

# Kinds of Abnormalities

-> A bnormal vibration
-> Limit temperature 
-> Abnormal pressure 
-> Overload

# Objective

Whenever there is wear and tear of machine user of machine will get notification earlier than emergency situation

# How it will work

By using IOT and using data fees over internet you can easily track if your machine is running smooth and can track the trend of machine wear and tear

-> By simple sensors and software combining with simple hardware it will run smooth

-> If there will be emergency situation then there will be panic alaram before your machine actually breakdowns!

-> Your machine will run more time/duration and will provide better results by keeping in mind your data feed by the sensors over interval of data

-> Moreover there will be a crosscheck feature which will provide better results as sudden running accidents could be avoided and hence saving equipment and labour
